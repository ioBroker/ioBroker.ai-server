## ai-server adapter for ioBroker

Runs a local large language model with [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and manages its models.
The questions to the model stay in your network, no cloud account is needed.

What the adapter does:

- starts Ollama in a Docker container (via `@iobroker/plugin-docker`), or connects to an Ollama server that is already
  running in your network;
- downloads, loads, unloads and deletes models, shows them as objects and in the tab "Models" with their size, and
  deletes models that were not used for a while, if wanted;
- answers requests to the model via `sendTo` and via states;
- shows the state of the server, the queue and the speed of the last answer.

What it does not do:

- It does not control ioBroker devices by itself and does not execute tool calls of the model. That is the job of
  the adapter or script that sends the request.
- It does not run the model in the adapter process. The model runs in Ollama.
- Ollama has no user management: everyone who can reach its port can use and change it (see "Bind address").

Other adapters (javascript, admin, ai-toolbox, ai-assistant) can use the Ollama endpoint directly, see
[Use by other adapters](#use-by-other-adapters).

## Getting started

1. **Prepare the host.** For the backend "Docker container", Docker has to be installed and the user `iobroker` has to
   be in the group `docker`, see [Requirements](#requirements). Without Docker, install Ollama yourself and use the
   backend "External Ollama server".
2. **Install the adapter and create an instance.** On the first start, the image of Ollama is downloaded, which takes
   several minutes, see [The first start takes several minutes](#the-first-start-takes-several-minutes). The instance
   is ready when `info.connection` is `true` and `info.status` is `ready`.
3. **Check the instance settings.** The tab "Docker" shows whether Docker can be used. The defaults fit for a start:
   hardware "CPU", bind address `127.0.0.1`, port 11434.
4. **Download a model.** In the tab "Models", click "Download model" and enter a name, e.g. `qwen3:1.7b`. Choose a
   model that fits into the free memory, see [Memory](#memory).
5. **Make it the default model.** Select it as "Default model" in the tab "General" (downloaded models are marked
   with ✓) and save. Requests without a model use it.
6. **Ask a question.** In the tab "Chat" of the instance settings, type a question and press Enter, see
   [Tab "Chat"](#tab-chat). The first answer takes longer, as the model is loaded into memory first. Without the tab
   (admin older than 8.0.1), write the question into `ai-server.0.chat.prompt` in the tab "Objects"; the answer appears
   in `ai-server.0.chat.response`. If no answer comes, `info.lastError` and the log say why.
7. **Check the speed.** Below every answer, the chat shows how long it took and how fast the model writes (also in
   `metrics.lastDuration` and `metrics.tokensPerSecond`): at 5 tokens per second, an answer of 100 tokens (about
   75 words) takes 20 seconds. If that is too slow, try a smaller model; if the answers are poor, a larger one.
8. **Use it.** In scripts with `sendTo`, see [Requests to the model](#requests-to-the-model), or in other adapters via
   the OpenAI-compatible endpoint, see [Use by other adapters](#use-by-other-adapters).

## Requirements

- js-controller 7.1.0 or newer, admin 7.8.21 or newer (the tab "Chat" needs admin 8.0.1 or newer), Node.js 22.19 or
  newer.
- For the backend "Docker container":
  - a Linux host (e.g. Raspberry Pi OS, Debian, Ubuntu) with Docker Engine 20.10 or newer;
  - the user `iobroker` needs access to the Docker socket. Add it to the group `docker` and restart ioBroker:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker iobroker
    iob restart
    ```
  - Images: `ollama/ollama:latest` for the CPU, `ollama/ollama:rocm` for AMD graphics cards (ROCm).
    The models are stored in the Docker volume `iob_ai_server_0_models` (for instance 0), see
    [Where the models are stored](#where-the-models-are-stored). This volume is not part of the ioBroker backup:
    models are several GB in size and can be downloaded again at any time.
- For the backend "External Ollama server": a running Ollama that can be reached from the ioBroker host. On Windows,
  install [Ollama for Windows](https://ollama.com/download) and use this backend.

### Memory

A model needs about as much free memory (RAM) as its download size, plus 1-2 GB. The list in the instance settings
offers these models:

| Model         | Download size | Free memory needed |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|
| `qwen3:1.7b`  | 1.4 GB        | about 3 GB         |
| `llama3.2:3b` | 2.0 GB        | about 3-4 GB       |
| `qwen3:4b`    | 2.5 GB        | about 4 GB         |
| `qwen3.5:4b`  | 3.3 GB        | about 5 GB         |
| `qwen3:8b`    | 5.2 GB        | about 7 GB         |
| `qwen3.5:9b`  | 6.6 GB        | about 8 GB         |
| `gemma4:e4b`  | 6.6 GB        | about 8 GB         |
| `gpt-oss:20b` | 13.8 GB       | about 16 GB        |

On a Raspberry Pi, stay with small models (up to about 4B parameters, e.g. `qwen3:1.7b` or `llama3.2:3b`).
Without a graphics card, the answers of larger models take a long time. Even smaller models like `qwen3:0.6b` answer
faster, but their answers are much less reliable.

## Configuration

Tab **General**:

| Setting               | Meaning                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Backend               | "Docker container (managed by ioBroker)" or "External Ollama server"                        |
| External server URL   | only for the external server, e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:11434`                              |
| Default model         | used for requests without a model, downloaded at the start if it is missing (see below)     |
| Delete unused models after | number of days, `0` (default) = never, see [Deleting unused models](#deleting-unused-models) |
| Request timeout       | maximum duration of a request to the model in seconds (default 300)                         |
| Parallel requests     | how many requests are sent to the model at the same time (default 1)                       |
| Maximum queue length  | requests beyond this number of waiting ones fail at once (default 10)                       |

Tab **Docker** (only for the backend "Docker container"):

| Setting                                    | Meaning                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Docker status                              | shows whether Docker can be used on the host                                  |
| Hardware                                   | "CPU" or "AMD GPU (ROCm)". ROCm needs `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri` on the host   |
| Bind address                               | `127.0.0.1` (default): only this host reaches Ollama. `0.0.0.0`: the whole network reaches it, **without any password**. The adapter writes a warning to the log then |
| Port                                       | port of Ollama on the host (default 11434)                                   |
| Keep model in memory                       | how long a model stays loaded after the last request: `5m`, `1h`, `0` (unload at once) or `-1` (forever) |
| Update the container image automatically   | off by default. If on, a newer `ollama/ollama` image is downloaded at the start of the instance |
| Stop the container when the instance stops | off by default, so a restart of the adapter keeps the model in memory        |

If you change the hardware or switch to the external server, the instance stops the container of the previous choice
when it restarts after saving. The container is only stopped, not deleted: when you switch back, the same container is
started again, together with the downloaded models.

NVIDIA graphics cards are not supported yet.

## Models

Ollama starts without any model. Choose the **default model** in the instance settings (tab "General"):
the list shows the downloaded models, marked with ✓, and a few recommended ones with their download size.
Any other name from [ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library) can be typed in, e.g. `qwen3:14b`.
If the default model is not downloaded yet, the adapter downloads it when the instance starts.

Check the free memory first, see [Memory](#memory).

To download more models, use "Download model" in the tab "Models" (see below), write the name into
`ai-server.0.control.pull` or use `sendTo`. The progress is shown in `control.pullProgress` (0-100 %), errors in the
log and in `info.lastError`. Only one download runs at a time.

### Where the models are stored

With the backend "Docker container", the models are stored in the Docker volume `iob_ai_server_0_models` (for
instance 0), in the data directory of Docker on the host. This command shows the path:

```bash
sudo docker volume inspect iob_ai_server_0_models --format '{{ .Mountpoint }}'
```

By default, it is `/var/lib/docker/volumes/iob_ai_server_0_models/_data` on the system disk, on a Raspberry Pi usually
the SD card. To store the models on an SSD, move the data directory of Docker (`data-root`, see the
[Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/daemon/#daemon-data-directory)). This moves all volumes of the
host, and also the images and containers unless Docker uses the containerd image store (then they stay in
`/var/lib/containerd`). All containers stop meanwhile. Example for an SSD mounted at `/ssd`:

1. Stop Docker and copy its data:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop docker docker.socket
   sudo mkdir -p /ssd/docker-data
   sudo cp -a /var/lib/docker/. /ssd/docker-data/
   ```
2. Enter the new directory in `/etc/docker/daemon.json` (create the file if it does not exist; if it exists, add the
   line to the other settings):
   ```json
   { "data-root": "/ssd/docker-data" }
   ```
3. Start Docker and check the directory:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo docker info --format '{{ .DockerRootDir }}'
   ```

When everything runs again, the old directory `/var/lib/docker` can be deleted.

With the backend "External Ollama server", the models are where that server stores them: by default
`/usr/share/ollama/.ollama/models` on Linux, `~/.ollama/models` on macOS and `C:\Users\<user>\.ollama\models` on
Windows, or in the directory of the environment variable `OLLAMA_MODELS`.

### Tab "Models"

The tab "Models" of the instance settings shows a card per downloaded model with:

- the size on the disk, the number of parameters and the quantization;
- whether the model is loaded and whether it is the default model;
- when it was used the last time and, if [Deleting unused models](#deleting-unused-models) is on, when it will be
  deleted;
- buttons to load, unload and delete the model. Before deleting, a dialog asks for confirmation and shows how much
  space is freed.

Above the cards, the size of all models together is shown, and "Download model" downloads a new one with a progress
dialog. If the browser is closed meanwhile, the download goes on. The same view is in the tab "Devices" of admin, if that tab is
switched on.

The marks "loaded" and "default model" on the cards need admin 8.0.1 or newer; older versions do not show them.

### Deleting unused models

With "Delete unused models after" (tab "General"), models that were not used for the given number of days are deleted
from the disk, to free the space. A model counts as used:

- while it is loaded; this is checked every 30 seconds, also for requests that other adapters send to Ollama directly;
- when it answers a request via this adapter (`chat`, `generate`, `chat.prompt`).

The time of the last use is in `models.<id>.lastUsed`. A model the adapter sees for the first time counts as used at
that moment, so the days start to count when the option or the model is new. Models are checked once per hour, the first
time one hour after the connection to Ollama. The default model, loaded models and a model being downloaded are never
deleted automatically.

Not seen as use: requests while the instance is stopped, and short requests of other adapters to a model that is
unloaded at once afterwards ("Keep model in memory" = `0`). Deleted models can be downloaded again at any time.

Every downloaded model gets a channel below `models`, e.g. `models.qwen3_4b` for `qwen3:4b`:

| State           | Meaning                                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `name`          | original name, e.g. `qwen3:4b`                |
| `size`          | size on disk in bytes                         |
| `parameterSize` | number of parameters, e.g. `4.0B`             |
| `quantization`  | e.g. `Q4_K_M`                                 |
| `loaded`        | the model is in memory                        |
| `lastUsed`      | time of the last use (loaded or answered)     |
| `load`          | button: load the model into memory            |
| `unload`        | button: remove the model from memory          |

Ollama loads a model on the first request by itself and unloads it after the time set in "Keep model in memory".
`loaded` is updated every 30 seconds. Models deleted in Ollama disappear from the objects; `control.refresh` reads the
list at once, e.g. after a model was downloaded with the Ollama command line.

### Managing models with `sendTo`

Every command is answered with `{ result }` or `{ error }`.

| Command       | Message                  | Result                                                     |
|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `listModels`  | `{}`                     | `[{ name, size, parameterSize, quantization, loaded }]`    |
| `pull`        | `{ model: 'qwen3:4b' }`  | `{ started: true }` at once, progress in `control.pullProgress` |
| `deleteModel` | `{ model: 'qwen3:4b' }`  | `{ deleted: true }`                                        |
| `loadModel`   | `{ model: 'qwen3:4b' }`  | `{ loaded: true }`                                         |
| `unloadModel` | `{ model: 'qwen3:4b' }`  | `{ unloaded: true }`                                       |

```js
const answer = await sendToAsync('ai-server.0', 'listModels', {});
if (answer.error) {
    log(answer.error, 'warn');
} else {
    for (const model of answer.result) {
        log(`${model.name}: ${(model.size / 1e9).toFixed(1)} GB${model.loaded ? ', loaded' : ''}`);
    }
}
```

## Requests to the model

### Tab "Chat"

The tab "Chat" of the instance settings is for trying the models. Choose a downloaded model, type a message and press
Enter (Shift+Enter starts a new line). Every message is sent together with the whole conversation, so the model knows
what was said before; "Clear the chat" starts a new one. Below every answer, the model, the duration, the number of
tokens and the speed in tokens per second are shown; the tokens of the prompt are shown as a tooltip.

- "System prompt" is sent with every message, e.g. `Answer briefly in German.`
- "Think before answering" lets a thinking model think first; the thinking can be opened above the answer. It is off by
  default, as it takes many times longer.
- The conversation is kept while the settings are open, also when switching the tabs, but it is not stored.
- The messages go through the queue like all other requests (see [Queue and metrics](#queue-and-metrics)) and update
  the states `metrics.*`.

The tab needs admin 8.0.1 or newer.

### With `sendTo`

| Command       | Message                                                                           | Result                                                                |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `chat`        | `{ model?, messages: [{ role, content, images? }], system?, options?, format?, tools?, think? }` | `{ message, model, durationMs, promptTokens, completionTokens, tokensPerSecond }` |
| `generate`    | `{ model?, prompt, system?, options?, format?, think? }`                          | `{ response, thinking?, model, durationMs, promptTokens, completionTokens, tokensPerSecond }` |
| `status`      | `{}`                                                                              | `{ connected, status, version, baseUrl, loadedModels }`               |
| `getEndpoint` | `{}`                                                                              | `{ ollama, openai }`, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:11434` and `…/v1`        |

- Without `model`, the default model of the instance settings is used.
- `system` is put in front of the messages as a system message.
- `options`, `format`, `tools` and `think` are passed to Ollama unchanged, see the
  [Ollama API](https://docs.ollama.com/api/chat). The adapter does not execute tool calls itself:
  `message.tool_calls` is returned to the caller, who sends the result back as a message with the role `tool`.
- Thinking models (e.g. `qwen3`) think before they answer, unless `think: false` is given.
  The thinking is returned separately in `message.thinking`, not in `content`. On a Raspberry Pi 5, a short question
  to `qwen3:0.6b` took 22 s with thinking and 0.4 s without.

```js
const answer = await sendToAsync('ai-server.0', 'chat', {
    system: 'Answer in one sentence.',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Why is the sky blue?' }],
    think: false,
});
if (answer.error) {
    log(answer.error, 'warn');
} else {
    log(answer.result.message.content);
}
```

### With states

Write a question into `chat.prompt`; the answer appears in `chat.response`. `chat.running` is `true` meanwhile.
`chat.model` selects the model (empty = default model) and `chat.system` sets a system prompt. Thinking is switched
off, as it takes many times longer; set `chat.think` to `true` to let a thinking model think first (a model that cannot
think then answers with an error). All three are read when the question is written. Every question is answered on its
own, without the previous ones.

### Queue and metrics

At most "Parallel requests" requests (`chat`, `generate`, `chat.prompt`) run at the same time, further ones wait.
If more than "Maximum queue length" requests are waiting, a new one fails at once. `info.status` is `busy` while
requests run.

After every answer the adapter writes `metrics.lastDuration` (ms, without the time in the queue),
`metrics.tokensPerSecond`, `metrics.promptTokens` and `metrics.completionTokens`.

Prompts and answers are only logged on level `debug`, shortened to 200 characters.

While Ollama is starting, `info.status` is `starting`. On the first start, Docker downloads the image of Ollama first,
which can take several minutes. If Docker cannot be used, `info.status` is `error` and the log says why.

## Use by other adapters

The address of Ollama is returned by `sendTo('ai-server.0', 'getEndpoint', {})`:

- Ollama API: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`
- OpenAI-compatible API: `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` (with `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models`)

Ollama needs no API key. Where a key has to be entered, any text works, Ollama ignores it.

`127.0.0.1` only works for adapters on the same host as Ollama. If the other adapter runs on another host (multihost),
set "Bind address" to `0.0.0.0` and use the IP address of the Ollama host, e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:11434/v1`.
Then everyone in the network can use Ollama without a password, so protect the port with a firewall if needed.

Small local models are much slower than cloud models and make more mistakes, especially with tools. Load the model
before the first request (`models.<id>.load`) and keep it in memory ("Keep model in memory", e.g. `1h` or `-1`), so
the first answer does not wait for the model to load.

### admin: system settings, tab "AI"

Since admin 8.3.5, the AI settings can be set up once for all adapters:

- Provider: "Custom (OpenAI-compatible)"
- Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`
- API key: leave empty
- Model: the name as in Ollama, e.g. `qwen3:4b`. The test button reads the list of models from Ollama.

The assistant of admin sends the ioBroker tools with every request, so choose a model that supports tool calling,
e.g. one of the `qwen3` models (marked with "tools" on [ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library)).

### javascript

- javascript 10.4.8 and newer: keep "Credentials type" on "System-wide AI settings" and set up the tab "AI" of admin
  as described above.
- Own settings (also older versions): "Credentials type" = "Manual",
  "Custom API Base URL" = `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`, leave "API key (optional)" empty, check with "Test Custom API".
  The model is chosen in the AI chat of the script editor.

Scripts can use the `sendTo` commands of this adapter, see [Requests to the model](#requests-to-the-model).

### ai-toolbox and ai-assistant

Both have a tab "Custom" for an own inference server:

- "URL for Inference Server": `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1/chat/completions`. Here the complete address is needed,
  including `/chat/completions`.
- API token: any text or empty.
- Enter the models by name in the table, e.g. `qwen3:4b`, save the settings and then choose the model in the tool
  (ai-toolbox) or in the general settings (ai-assistant).

ai-toolbox waits at most 30 seconds for an answer, and this cannot be changed. Keep the model loaded and use a small
one. In ai-assistant, raise "Timeout (in seconds)" (default 30) to 120 or more on a CPU.

## Troubleshooting

Errors are written to the log and to `info.lastError`. Set the log level of the instance to `debug` to see every
request, with prompts and answers shortened to 200 characters.

**The instance does not run for several minutes after the first start.** The image of Ollama is being downloaded, see
[The first start takes several minutes](#the-first-start-takes-several-minutes).

**`info.status` is `error`, the log says "Docker is not available on this host".** Docker is not installed, or the user
`iobroker` has no access to it. Install Docker Engine and add `iobroker` to the group `docker` (see
[Requirements](#requirements)), or use the backend "External Ollama server".

**The log says "Ollama does not answer yet".** The container is still starting, or the external server cannot be
reached. The adapter keeps trying. For the external server, check the URL: `http://<address>:11434/api/version` opened
in a browser has to show the version of Ollama.

**The tab "Docker" says that Docker cannot be checked.** The js-controller of the host the instance runs on is too old
to check Docker for admin. Only the display is missing; the adapter uses Docker anyway.

**"No model given and no default model set in the instance settings".** Select a default model in the tab "General",
or name the model in the request (`model` in `sendTo`, `chat.model` for the states).

**Ollama says that the model is not found.** The model is not downloaded, or the name is misspelled. Names are written
as in Ollama, with the tag after the colon, e.g. `qwen3:1.7b`. The downloaded models are listed in the tab "Models".

**"model requires more system memory".** The model does not fit into the free memory. Choose a
smaller model (see [Memory](#memory)) or unload other models.

**"Ollama did not answer within 300 s".** The model is too slow for this request on this hardware. Use a smaller model,
switch thinking off (`think: false`) or raise "Request timeout".

**The first answer after a pause takes much longer.** The model was unloaded and has to be loaded again. Raise "Keep
model in memory", e.g. to `1h` or `-1`.

## Known limitations

### The first start takes several minutes

On the first start, `@iobroker/plugin-docker` downloads the image `ollama/ollama:latest` before the adapter itself starts.
Until the download is finished, the instance is shown as not running. The log shows
`Pulling image ollama/ollama:latest for own container iob_ai_server_0_ollama. This may take some time...`.
On a Raspberry Pi 5 this took about 5 minutes. Later starts are fast, as the image is already there.

### NVIDIA graphics cards

Not supported yet: `@iobroker/plugin-docker` cannot pass a GPU (`gpus: all`) to the container. Use the CPU, an AMD card
with ROCm, or an Ollama installed directly on the host with the backend "External Ollama server".
